This library is currently under development, incomplete, and not properly tested, thus should not be considered ready for production systems.\r\n\r\n##Features implemented so far:\r\n\r\n- All geometries with basic operations, such as: intersects, contains, within, etc.\r\n- Algorithms related to intersections.\r\n- Geometry graph.\r\n- STRTree.","tagline":"Objective Topology Suite (OTS) is an Objective-C adaptation of Java Topology Suite (JTS) and GEOS library.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
