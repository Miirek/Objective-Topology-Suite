#Objective Topology Suite (OTS)

I've found this project on google code. Original repository is here http://code.google.com/p/objective-topology-suite/
As I need something like this, I've decided to put this code here.

Objective Topology Suite (OTS) is an Objective-C adaptation of Java Topology Suite (JTS) and GEOS library that primarily targeted for iPhone platform, but should work as well for Mac OSX. This library is currently under development, incomplete, and not properly tested, thus should not be considered ready for production systems.

Features implemented so far:

All geometries with basic operations, such as: intersects, contains, within, etc.
Algorithms related to intersections.
Geometry graph.
STRTree.
